Tools for the use of the Otago Atmosphere and Climate group

Add shared tools here for others in the group to use. We mainly use Matlab code, 
but all other useful code is welcome too.

Simple rules:
1. Use approriate directory structure to keep it easier to find helpful code. 
   E.g. Code used for satellite data should go in "satellite" directory (or similar).
2. Function names should help identify what the code does.
   e.g. "ReadOMIdata.m" is a good name for code that reads in OMI data from binary files.
3. Include comments in your code!
4. Notify others of mistakes you find so we can fix them!
